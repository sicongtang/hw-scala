L2-regularized problems are generally easier to solve than L1-regularized due to smoothness.
However, L1 regularization can help promote sparsity in weights leading to smaller and more interpretable models, the latter of which can be useful for feature selection.
It is not recommended to train models without any regularization, especially when the number of training examples is small.
